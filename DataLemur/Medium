Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. 
Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user.
Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

SELECT user_id,
        spend,
        transaction_date
from (SELECT *,
      row_number() over (PARTITION by user_id order by transaction_date asc) as row_number 
from transactions) as table1
where row_number = 3;

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. 
Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique 
that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.

SELECT 
        user_id,
        tweet_date,
        ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY tweet_date
        ROWS Between 2 PRECEDING and current row), 2) rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets
