Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. 
Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user.
Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

SELECT user_id,
        spend,
        transaction_date
from (SELECT *,
      row_number() over (PARTITION by user_id order by transaction_date asc) as row_number 
from transactions) as table1
where row_number = 3;

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. 
Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique 
that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.

SELECT 
        user_id,
        tweet_date,
        ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY tweet_date
        ROWS Between 2 PRECEDING and current row), 2) rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. 
Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, 
and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.

SELECT measurement_day,
            SUM(CASE WHEN row_num %2 != 0 then measurement_value else 0 end ) odd_num,           
            SUM(CASE WHEN row_num %2 = 0 then measurement_value else 0 end ) even_num
FROM (
        SELECT measurement_value,CAST(measurement_time AS DATE) measurement_day,
        Row_number() over (PARTITION BY CAST(measurement_time AS DATE) order by measurement_time) row_num
from measurements
                  ) as new
group by measurement_day

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. 
The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. 
Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

with cte1 AS
(SELECT card_name,
        issued_amount,
        RANK() over (PARTITION BY card_name order by issue_year, issue_month ) rank1
from monthly_cards_issued
)
SELECT card_name,
        issued_amount
from cte1
where rank1= 1
order by issued_amount desc

Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.

Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table. 
Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.

Assumptions:

If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, they should be assigned the same ranking, 
and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5).
For instance, if both Ed Sheeran and Bad Bunny appear in the Top 10 five times, they should both be ranked 1st and the next artist should be ranked 2nd.

with top_10_songs AS
(
SELECT song_id, rank
from global_song_rank
where rank <= 10
),
counted_songs as
(
SELECT COUNT(top_10_songs.song_id) as counted_song_id, songs.artist_id
from songs
join top_10_songs on top_10_songs.song_id = songs.song_id
GROUP BY artist_id
),
ranked AS
(
SELECT artists.artist_name artist_name, 
        Dense_rank() OVER (order by counted_song_id Desc) artist_rank
from artists
join counted_songs on counted_songs.artist_id= artists.artist_id
) 
SELECT artist_name, artist_rank
from ranked
where artist_rank <= 5 
order by artist_rank ASC, artist_name ASC;
