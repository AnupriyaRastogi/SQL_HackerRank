Assume you're given the tables below about Facebook Page and Page likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages which do not possess any likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order.

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. 
Write a query that determines which parts with the assembly steps have initiated the assembly process but remain unfinished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Select part,
        assembly_step
from parts_assembly
where finish_date is null

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. 
Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

SELECT
      sum(case when device_type = 'laptop' then 1 else 0 end ) laptop_view,
      sum(case when device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') then 1 else 0 end) mobile_view
from viewership

Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.

Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. 
Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.

with completed_order as
(SELECT *
from trades 
where status= 'Completed'),
count_order as 
  (SELECT u.city,
          COUNT (*) AS total_count
  FROM users u
  join completed_order as co on u.user_id=co.user_id
  group by u.city)
select *
from count_order
order by total_count DESC
LIMIT 3

Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform. 
Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Clarification:

Duplicate job listings refer to two jobs at the same company with the same title and description.


with new AS
(
select title,
description, 
company_id,
COUNT(job_id) as job_count
from job_listings
GROUP BY title,
description, 
company_id)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS co_w_duplicate_jobs
from new
where job_count >1;

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, 
write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. 
Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

SELECT user_id,
        EXTRACT(Days from (Max(post_date)- Min(post_date))) as Between_days

CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. 
Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find the top 3 most profitable drugs sold, and how much profit they made. 
Assume that there are no ties in the profits. Display the result from the highest to the lowest total profit.

Definition:

cogs stands for Cost of Goods Sold which is the direct cost associated with producing the drug.
Total Profit = Total Sales - Cost of Goods Sold


select drug,
(total_sales - cogs) total_profit
from pharmacy_sales
GROUP BY drug, total_sales, cogs
order by total_profit DESC
LIMIT 3

CVS Health is analyzing its pharmacy sales data, and how well different products are selling in the market. 
Each drug is exclusively manufactured by a single manufacturer.

Write a query to identify the manufacturers associated with the drugs that resulted in losses for CVS Health and calculate the total amount of losses incurred.

Output the manufacturer's name, the number of drugs associated with losses, and the total losses in absolute value. 
Display the results sorted in descending order with the highest losses displayed at the top.

SELECT 
    manufacturer, 
    COUNT(drug) drug_count,
    SUM(cogs-total_sales) total_loss
from pharmacy_sales
where total_sales < cogs
group by manufacturer
order by total_loss desc

OR 

SELECT 
    manufacturer, 
    COUNT(drug) drug_count,
   ABS(SUM(total_sales-cogs)) total_loss
from pharmacy_sales
where (total_sales-cogs) <=0

CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling.

Write a query to find the total drug sales for each manufacturer. Round your answer to the closest million,
and report your results in descending order of total sales.

Because this data is being directly fed into a dashboard which is being seen by business stakeholders, format your result like this: "$36 million".

SELECT  
        manufacturer,
        CONCAT('$',ROUND(CAST(SUM(total_sales) as float)/1000000),' million') sales_mil
FROM pharmacy_sales
Group by manufacturer
order by SUM(total_sales) DESC;

Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. 
New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

Definition:

action_date refers to the date when users activated their accounts and confirmed their sign-up through text messages.

SELECT e.user_id
from emails e
join texts t on e.email_id=t.email_id
where EXTRACT(Days from (t.action_date-e.signup_date)) = 1
